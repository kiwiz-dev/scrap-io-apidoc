# Introduction

Welcome to Scrap.io API! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Gmap Search API to search on Google Maps, or the Gmap Enrich API to look up Google Maps information related to a domain name, an email or a phone.

The API is organized around REST. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

We also have some specific language examples to make integration easier. You can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

The base url for all endpoints is:

`https://scrap.io/api/v1/`
